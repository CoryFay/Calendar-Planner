# Calendar-Planner

## By CoryFay

This repository will act as your daily planner. It was set up with time blocks for the normal working day; 9-5. 
The time blocks will be color coded to correspond with the time of day, specifically by the hour. If the hour has passed the block will 
notify you by changing colors to grey. There is a setting for the present hour, and also for future hours. 

Within these blocks you will also be able to add plans that you have for the day. **Just be sure to click that save button after entering your data!**
By saving, your input will be stored and you will not lose your progress even if you have to close out of the page!
This will certainly ensure that you never miss an appointment again!!
